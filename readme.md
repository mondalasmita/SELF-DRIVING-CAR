# Self-Driving Car Simulation Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Self-Driving Car Simulation project! This endeavor combines my passion for autonomous vehicles with my love for web development. In this project, I aimed to create a visually appealing simulation that encapsulates various aspects of self-driving car technology.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the simulation.
- **CSS**: To style and enhance the visual elements.
- **JavaScript**: Powering the mechanics, artificial sensors, collision detection, and overall interactivity.

## Features

1. **Car Driving Mechanics**: Implemented realistic car movement using JavaScript to simulate smooth and dynamic driving behavior.

2. **Defining the Road**: Crafted a virtual road environment using HTML and CSS to provide a tangible context for the self-driving car.

3. **Artificial Sensors**: Integrated sensors within the simulation to mimic the input a self-driving car would receive from its surroundings.

4. **Collision Detection**: Implemented a robust collision detection system to enhance the realism and safety aspects of the simulation.

5. **Simulating Traffic**: Created a traffic simulation element to mimic the challenges and interactions a self-driving car might face in real-world scenarios.

6. **Neural Network Integration**: Introduced a basic neural network to simulate decision-making processes, allowing the car to adapt and learn from its environment.

7. **Parallelization**: Utilized JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities to simulate parallel processing, enhancing the efficiency of the simulation.

8. **Genetic Algorithm**: Incorporated a genetic algorithm to optimize certain aspects of the self-driving behavior, enhancing the car's ability to navigate the environment.
